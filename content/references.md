**Art Collecting of Emperors and Scholars in Ancient China**

Presenter: Wang Tao

Thursday, September 13, 6:30[pm]{.smallcaps}

\$10; \$5 My Mia members, free for members of the Asian Art Affinity Group

In Chinese history, there were two categories of collector who distinguished themselves through their collection of ancient bronzes: the emperor and the social elite, who were usually educated officials. This lecture will focus on a number of archaic bronzes that were once collected by Chinese emperors and prominent scholars. Wang Tao will aim to explore these significant objects from ancient China and their deep and rich social and cultural histories. He'll describe their evolution from everyday cooking and serving vessels to powerful symbols of divine omens for dynastic rulers, as well as how they played an important role in forming relationships among the social elites.

*Wang Tao, PhD, is an archaeologist and art historian specializing in early Chinese art. He is the Pritzker Chair of Asian Art and Curator of Chinese Art at the Art Institute of Chicago.*

**Don't Read This! Don't See This!: Censorship and the Creative Truth of Words and Art**

Presenters: Dennis Michael Jon and Yasufumi Nakamori

Thursday, September 27, 6:30[pm]{.smallcaps}

\$10; \$5 My Mia members, free for members of the Library Affinity Group

Censorship and the power of expression are relevant concepts in today's world and the "fake news" environment. Books and art are both connected to the ideals of intellectual freedom. As each has its own kind of beauty and sense of creative truth, they share a common connection to museums and their collections. During the 1920s and 30s in Germany, John Hartfield and other Dada artists published their anti-Nazi collages in *AIZ* (Textile Workers) magazine. After the seizure of power by Hitler the *AIZ* went into exile in Prague, and under editor-in-chief Franz Carl Weiskopf was renamed *Die Volks Illlustriete* in 1936. Just befoe the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia in 1939, the publication was moved to Paris, where it published at least four issues before its demise.Yasufumi Nakamori, curator and head of the Department of Photography and New Media, will talk about issues of this important publication, which he helped Mia's Library purchase.

Dennis Michael Jon, Mia's Senior Associate Curator in the Department of Prints and Drawings, will talk about the collaborative artists' book *Ten Years of Uzbekistan* (1994) by British artist Ken Campbell and Irish author David King, a work with a focus on political oppression, and Goya's *Los Caprichos* (1797/98), an example of self-repression by the artist (fearful for his life because of the work's content) as well as a satirical political treatise about the Spanish government and merchant class.

After the talk, audience members will gather in Mia's Library and Print and Drawing Study Room to see the works up close and talk further with the curators. Books from the Library's collection of "degenerate" artists and artists who have some connection to the theme of censorship or intellectual creative expression will be displayed for viewing on the Library's Reading Room tables. This event is held to coincide with Banned Books Week, which celebrates freedom to read and the free expression of ideas.

To celebrate "Horse Nation of the Očhéthi Šakówiŋ," join us for a panel presentation of curators, artists, and scholars associated with this important exhibition. "Horse Nation" explores how horses shape the history, spirituality, and culture of the Dakhóta, Nakhóta, and Lakȟóta (Dakota, Nakota, and Lakota) people, collectively known as the Očhéthi Šakówiŋ (Seven Council Fires). Horses serve as allies in hunting and in battle but are revered for more than their utility. Horses were, and still are, recognized as relatives and are vital members of the community.

Amiotte's work has been showcased in more than 100 state, national, and international exhibitions including permanent collections at the Smithsonian and the U.S. Department of the Interior. He has received dozens of prestigious awards including an Artist Fellowship from the Bush Foundation and Artist of the Year by the South Dakota Hall of Fame, as well as three honorary doctoral degrees for his work as an artist and educator.*

*Keith BraveHeart is active artist and advocate for contemporary Native art. He is a citizen of the Titonwan (Lakota) Nation of the Oceti Sakowin (Seven Council Fires Confederacy, also referred to as the Sioux). BraveHeart received his BFA from the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, N.M., and his master's in fine arts from the University of South Dakota. In 2014 he produced the documentary film* We Are a Horse Nation*, a concept he expanded in 2015, in partnership with the Heritage Center at Red Cloud Indian School (Pine Ridge,* *S.D.), into a traveling exhibition, "The Horse Nation of Očhéthi Šakówiŋ."*

**Empathy, Art and the Revolution of Human Relationships **

Presenter: Roman Krznaric

Sunday, October 7, 2[pm]{.smallcaps}

Free, tickets required; tickets available September 14.

Drawing on his international best seller *Empathy: Why it Matters, and How to Get It*, social philosopher Roman Krznaric reveals how empathy---the ability to step into the shoes of another person and see the world from his or her perspective---can not only enrich personal life but help create social change. Empathy, he argues, has the power to transform relationships, from the personal to the political. Krznaric explores how art and culture help us expand our empathic imaginations, discussing everything from ancient Greek theater and Renaissance painting to the history of cinema and participatory artworks such as the Empathy Museum, which he founded in London. At the same time, he explores empathy through the lens of neuroscience and industrial design, and its role in eroding conflicts in the Middle East and beyond. Book signing to follow.

*Roman Krznaric is a social philosopher whose books, including* Empathy, How Should We Live?*,* Carpe Diem*, and* How to Find Fulfilling Work*, have been published in more than 20 languages. He is the founder of the world's first Empathy Museum and of the digital Empathy Library, and was also a founding faculty member of the global emotional intelligence organization the School of Life. He is currently a research fellow of the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco, and a research associate at the Design Against Crime Research Centre at Central Saint Martins college of art and design in London. *

**The Historical Record of Teotihuacan-Maya Relations**

Presenter: David Stuart

Saturday, October 20, 11[am]{.smallcaps}

\$10; \$5 My Mia members, free for members of the Native American Art Affinity Group

The year 378 [ce]{.smallcaps} saw a major political disruption in the central Maya lowlands, widely referred to as the "entrada." This key event generally correlates with a significant appearance of Teotihuacan-related material culture in the region, as first defined by excavation projects at Tikal and surrounding sites in the 1960s. Since then, decipherment of hieroglyphic texts from Tikal and nearby centers have shown that the entrada was described as the "arrival" of a mysterious character known as Sihyaj K'ahk', who for many years wielded significant power over the region. Archaeologist David Stuart will examine the latest historical evidence regarding this transformative event, including new readings that confirm the interpretation of the arrival as a military conquest alongside the establishment a new political order and alliance network with strong Teotihuacan connections. Although the nature of this long-distance interaction between Teotihuacan and the Maya lowlands remains poorly understood, multiple references to the "arrival" in later histories testify to its importance in the cultural memory of the Late Classic Maya.

*David Stuart is an archaeologist and epigrapher specializing in the study of ancient Mesoamerica, especially Maya civilization. Winner of a MacArthur Fellowship, Stuart is the David and Linda Schele Professor of Mesoamerican Art and Writing at the University of Texas at Austin. *

**The Osiris Mysteries in Egypt's Sunken Cities**

Presenter: Franck Goddio

Sunday, October 28, 2[pm]{.smallcaps}; and Thursday, November 1, 11[am]{.smallcaps} & 6:30[pm]{.smallcaps}

Free for members; tickets required

Mia's special exhibition "Sunken Cities: Egypt's Lost Worlds" focuses on the discoveries of Franck Goddio, a pioneer of modern maritime archaeology. Goddio will discuss his work in three member-only talks. These lectures are free for members, but tickets are required. Advance tickets are recommended.

Franck Goddio initiated several shipwreck excavations, including seven junks dating from the 11th to 16th centuries, two Spanish galleons, and two trading vessels of the British East India Company. His most significant project began in 1992, when Goddio's team started its investigation of a portion of Egypt's Bay of Alexandria, where he discovered, mapped, and began excavating the ancient Great Port of Alexandria. In 1996 he launched a research mission in Aboukir Bay off the coast of Alexandria. The team of archaeologists, Egyptologists, historians, geologists, geophysicists, and computer engineers made a breakthrough in 2000 when they discovered the submerged ancient city of Thonis-Heracleion and parts of the city of Canopus. Research at those sites continues, and the discoveries there are at the heart of "Sunken Cities: Egypt's Lost Worlds." The work of the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology in Egypt is performed in close cooperation with the Egyptian Ministry for Antiquities.

*Wanderlust and a passion for the sea runs in Franck Goddio's veins. He is the grandson of Éric de Bisschop, a navigator and writer who invented the modern catamaran while studying ancient navigational routes in the South Pacific. After serving as an economic advisor to the United Nations and the French foreign ministry, Goddio dedicated himself to underwater archaeology in the early 1980s and founded the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology, of which he currently serves as president. He is a visiting professor of Oxford University and the cofounder of the Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology.*
