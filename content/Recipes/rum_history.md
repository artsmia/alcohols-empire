## World Production Of Rum ##

The oldest and the most varied distilled spirit are known as rum. Rum is distilled from the extracts of the sugar cane plant or the by-product of sugar cane known as molasses. This is a test citation for Rum Book ({{<q-cite "Rum Reference">}}). Rum is an aged spirit which is usually aged in charred oak casks for a period of 30 years which is in cases of a few authentic brands but is usually aged for a period of 15 years and below. This is the link to a [wiki article on rum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum). Rum that is aged in charred oak casks get a golden to dark brown colour because of the oak casks. Rums which are aged in stainless steel tanks remain colourless. [^1]
