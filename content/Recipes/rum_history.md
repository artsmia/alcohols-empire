## World Production Of Rum ##

The oldest and the most varied distilled spirit are known as rum. Rum is distilled from the extracts of the sugar cane plant or the by-product of sugar cane known as molasses. Rum is an aged spirit which is usually aged in charred oak casks for a period of 30 years which is in cases of a few authentic brands but is usually aged for a period of 15 years and below. Rum that is aged in charred oak casks get a golden to dark brown colour because of the oak casks. Rums which are aged in stainless steel tanks remain colourless. [^1]

Rums vary from place to place depending on the tradition that they followed. Rum that originate from Puerto rico have a golden colour are light bodied and are aged for minimum 3 years while on the other side rums that originate from Jamaica are dark rum which are naturally fermented for a period of 3 weeks and are distilled twice in pot stills and are aged minimum for 5 years in oak casks. This is a test citation for Rum Book ({{<q-cite "Rum Reference">}}).

The majority of the world production of rum takes place in the Caribbean and Latin America which also include a few other countries. Rum is also produced by Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji islands, Mexico, India and Canada. The federal law states that rum should be distilled from the fermented products of sugar cane like sugar cane juice, sugar cane syrup or the by product or sugar cane which is molasses at less than 190 proof.

Dark rums are usually consumed neat or with a mixed while light rums are used to make cocktails. 2.2 billion dollars were generated in 2009 in the United States because of the sales of rum. This is the link to a [wiki article on rum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum).

### History of Rum ###

The origin of rum dates back to the ancient times. Fermented sugar cane juice is believed to be first developed in ancient India or china. It is believed that rum originated in the island of Barbados. Brazil also started rum production in 1620s. It was discovered by the people who planted sugar cane that the by-product of sugar cane which is molasses can be fermented into alcohol. [^2] The distillation process changed later in order to make the alcohol more concentrated and remove the impurities that were present. The Spanish and English have played an important role in distilling sugar cane throughout the West Indies.

### History of rum in Jamaica ###

In Jamaica sugar cane and the distilling process dates back to the 15th century. Jamaica has the perfect climate, fertile soil, spring water which is filtered by limestone. Jamaica became the producer of one of the finest rums because of their climatic conditions.

*The English use to transport rum back to England in barrels and they discovered that the amount of time the rum spent in the barrel along with the rocking of the ship gave a finer and smoother tasting rum. Entire paragraph is italic.*

### How rum got its name ###

The first recorded name of this alcohol was kill devil hills because of its alcohol properties. Island of Barbados used the name kill devil hills till the nineteenth century. Early 1650s a new name emerged called rumbullion which was later shortened to rum. Rumbustion was another term that was used for rum during the 17th century. A similar word to rum was rummage. Rummage was the place in ships where rum was stored in the ship for long journeys across the Atlantic. Number of theories suggests that rum got its name from the latin word of sugarcane which was saccharum officinarum.

### Raw materials used ###

*Sugarcane juice italic*: French rums are usually made of 100% sugarcane juice which is fermented and then aged. Rums which are made with 100% sugarcane contain high level of herbal aromas and are totally different from molasses based rums.

*Molasses italic*: When sugarcane is processed to make sugar the sugar cane juice is boiled until it starts to form crystals leaving behind a liquid known as molasses. The molasses depends upon how much time the juice is boiled for and how much sugar is extracted from that. **The more sugar the better grade of molasses and in turn the best quality rum is produced.** [^3]

### Fermentation Method ###

Natural fermentation: natural fermentation is when the distilleries depend on yeast that naturally occurs in the air and also in the sugar cane juice to convert the sugar into alcohol. Natural fermentation takes place in big open containers to expose it to the air and takes about 1 or 2 weeks to ferment.

Controlled fermentation (continuous): The most advance method of fermenting is the continuous fermentation process. The continuous fermentation process consists of a fermentation tank that continuously receives diluted molasses because of which the yeast keep converting the sugar into alcohol and it all gets collected which is further distilled. endnote reference[^4]
