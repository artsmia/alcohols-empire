**Art Collecting of Emperors and Scholars in Ancient China**\
Presenter: Wang Tao
Thursday, September 13, 6:30pm\
$10; $5 My Mia members, free for members of the Asian Art Affinity Group\
<br>
In Chinese history, there were two categories of collector who distinguished themselves through their collection of ancient bronzes: the emperor and the social elite, who were usually educated officials. This lecture will focus on a number of archaic bronzes that were once collected by Chinese emperors and prominent scholars. Wang Tao will aim to explore these significant objects from ancient China and their deep and rich social and cultural histories. He'll describe their evolution from everyday cooking and serving vessels to powerful symbols of divine omens for dynastic rulers, as well as how they played an important role in forming relationships among the social elites.\

**Don't Read This! Don't See This!:
<br>
Censorship and the Creative Truth of Words and Art**\
Presenters: Dennis Michael Jon and Yasufumi Nakamori
Thursday, September 27, 6:30pm\
$10; $5 My Mia members, free for members of the Library Affinity Group\
<br>
Censorship and the power of expression are relevant concepts in today's world and the "fake news" environment. Books and art are both connected to the ideals of intellectual freedom. As each has its own kind of beauty and sense of creative truth, they share a common connection to museums and their collections. During the 1920s and 30s in Germany, John Hartfield and other Dada artists published their anti-Nazi collages in *AIZ* (Textile Workers) magazine. After the seizure of power by Hitler the *AIZ* went into exile in Prague, and under editor-in-chief Franz Carl Weiskopf was renamed *Die Volks Illlustriete* in 1936. Just befoe the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia in 1939, the publication was moved to Paris, where it published at least four issues before its demise.Yasufumi Nakamori, curator and head of the Department of Photography and New Media, will talk about issues of this important publication, which he helped Mia's Library purchase.

Dennis Michael Jon, Mia's Senior Associate Curator in the Department of Prints and Drawings, will talk about the collaborative artists' book *Ten Years of Uzbekistan* (1994) by British artist Ken Campbell and Irish author David King, a work with a focus on political oppression, and Goya's *Los Caprichos* (1797/98), an example of self-repression by the artist (fearful for his life because of the work's content) as well as a satirical political treatise about the Spanish government and merchant class.

After the talk, audience members will gather in Mia's Library and Print and Drawing Study Room to see the works up close and talk further with the curators. Books from the Library's collection of "degenerate" artists and artists who have some connection to the theme of censorship or intellectual creative expression will be displayed for viewing on the Library's Reading Room tables. This event is held to coincide with Banned Books Week, which celebrates freedom to read and the free expression of ideas.
