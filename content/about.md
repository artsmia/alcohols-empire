The museum has seven curatorial areas: Arts of Africa & the Americas; Contemporary Art; Decorative Arts, Textiles & Sculpture; Asian Art; Paintings; Photography and New Media; and Prints and Drawings. Mia is one of the largest arts educators in Minnesota. More than a half-million people visit the museum each year, and a hundred thousand more are reached through the museum’s Art Adventure program for elementary schoolchildren.

## About Tattersall Distilling ##
Tattersall Distilling is an award-winning distillery and cocktail room based in Northeast Minneapolis in the Historic Thorp Building — a warehouse that was once a top-secret manufacturing location for the Norden bombsight in World War II.  Its extensive portfolio of over 30 all-natural spirits and liqueurs are always made from the best ingredients available. The cocktail room serves cocktails made exclusively with Tattersall spirits and fresh, house-made bitters, syrups, tonics, tinctures and shrubs.  As a result, Tattersall has earned national and international recognition with top honors from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, American Craft Spirits Association and American Distilling Institute for its spirits.  From
sourcing ingredients locally to implementing a comprehensive organics program, Tattersall is dedicated to cutting its carbon footprint. The distillery sources the majority of its grains from a sixth generation farmer just 50 miles north of its front door. Plus, spent grains are used as hog and cattle feed at a farm in the same town.  Tattersall is proud to partner with Hennepin County and the City of Minneapolis to continue to reduce its waste with a comprehensive organics program throughout the distillery and cocktail room.  You can find Tattersall products at bars, restaurants and liquor stores in 23 states across the country.
