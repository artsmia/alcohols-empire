*Alcohol's Empire: Distilled Spirits in the 1700s Atlantic World*
contains a collection of essays on the unique histories of distilled
spirits in Europe and the Americas and includes adaptations of historic
recipes for contemporary use as well as a video overview of the project
and process. The Alcohol's Empire project was a joint effort of the
Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia), the Wangensteen Historical Library
of Biology and Medicine at the University of Minnesota, and Tattersall
Distilling in Minneapolis.

This interdisciplinary exploration into alcohol's past was ignited by
Mia's commitment to breathe new life into its displays of historic
interiors by offering visitors new ways to connect with and experience
these spaces. Recipe selection was guided by the books in the
Wangensteen Historical Library's collections of recipes handwritten or
printed in English between the late 1600s and early 1800s. Tattersall
Distilling provided the practical expertise and artisanal knowledge
necessary to recreate these
historical recipes.
