**MILK PUNCH**
<br>
Tattersall followed this recipe to a tee, with one exception: they cut it in half, which yielded something shy of three gallons of punch. People must have stocked up for those voyages to the Indies!
<br>
<br>
- 10 lemons
<br>
- 2 Seville oranges
<br>
- 3 quarts brandy or rum
<br>
*Using a vegetable peeler, remove the peel from lemons and oranges, leaving as much of the white pith behind as possible. Place the peels in brandy or rum. Steep 24 hours.*
<br>
<br>
Add:
<br>
- 1 cup lemon juice
<br>
- 3 cups of orange juice
<br>
- 10 cups of water
<br>
- 2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
<br>
- 1.25 pounds refined sugar
<br>
*Steep another 24 hours.*
<br>
<br>
Add:
<br>
- 7 cups of boiling milk.
<br>
*Let stand for 12 hours, then strain through a sieve.
Strain again with cheesecloth or a coffee filter.
Repeat until the punch runs clear. Serve with ice and/or top with soda, if desired.*
