### Introduction

In 1724, Ann Ward wrote her name on the inside of a blank journal and titled it "Book of Receipts." Ward's recipe book, now part of the Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine, is an excellent example of the kinds of useful household information that people kept in these handwritten repositories. Although we don't have any information about Ward, her recipe book is a window into her 18th-century life.

In addition to the recipe for "Cherrie Water," which is transcribed below, Ward included culinary recipes such as "A ffrigasye of Chickins or Rabbitts," "A Rice pudding to Bake," "To make a seed cake," and "To Pickle little Gerkine Cowcummers."[^1] Culianary recipes like these provide some hints about the household in which Ward created this little book. The recipe for the fricacy of chickens or rabbits, for example, calls for "six little chickens." Although it is difficult to know how large a "little" chicken would have been in the 18th century, but they were likely somewhat smaller than our typical American grocery store chickens. The recipe for rice pudding, on the other hand, calls for one pound of rice, around 12 servings of rice according to modern standards. The number of little chickens and rice offer a sense of the size of Ward's household: these recipes were not designed to feed lots of people as you might expect in a noble household, but they are somewhat larger than recipes that Americans are accustomed to today.

Mingled among the recipes for food are recipes for human medicine and animal care. "The Purging Ale to be taken Every Springe" and "Snaile water which is good for any weakness to Recover Nature and the Jandy's or Consumption" highlight the role that Ann Ward had in helping to maintain the health of the people in her household.[^2] One recipe for animal care in particular offers further insight to the social status of Ann Ward's household: "Balls for Horses in Hunting Season."[^3] Ward asserts that "these balls will keep your Horse free from ... swel'd Legs & give him a Good appetite... They are very good for Coach Horses." Hunting on horseback was an elite leisure activity during this period, and having a coach horse would indicate that the household had a coach, which would have been inaccessible for many people on the lower rungs of society.

Our recipe for "Water of Flowers" comes from *The London-Distiller, Exactly and truly shewing The Way (in words at length, and not in mysterious CHARACTERS and FIGURES) to draw all Sorts of Spirits and Strong-Waters: To which is added Their Vertues, with Additions of many Excellent Waters*, published in 1667. Author John French includes a section called "Rules and Directions for extracting and drawing of *Low-Wines* and *Spirits*, to be Re-distilled into *Rich Spirits, Strong Waters,* or *Aqua-vitae* in which he describes the regulation of the Company of Distillers over distillation methods. He criticizes the cost-saving practice of some distillers to not re-distill their products: "What they save by their seeming thrift, they lose double in the excellency of their Wares."[^4] Thus, according to French, "The directions following are henceforth by them and every member of the Company \[of Distillers\], and their Successors, duly and exactly to be observed and practised from time to time for here everafter."[^5]

The differences in the ways that people distill today, both for thrift and taste, still leads to varying qualities of alcohol. Benley Gillman, head distiller at Tattersall Distilling, described the necessity of removing the "heads and tails" of distilled alcohol, which contain alcohols which are more toxic. "If you're not making aggressive cuts, more acetone and methanol remains \[in the product.\] It tastes funky. Everyone knows what nail polish smells like. Think of a bell curve: we cut the low parts to focus on the curve. We throw away more, but it gives us a better product. If you're aggressive, you're getting less but better \[product\]. The better it is before it's aged, the better it will be after it's aged.... At Tattersall, we cut aggressively to get the notes we want to accentuate. It also means you don't get a hangover with our products."

CLEAR SKIES AHEAD: Make it at Home
<br>
Clear Skies Ahead is our historical take on a classic Aviation. Developed in the early 20th century, an Aviation typically calls for maraschino liqueur, gin, creme de violette, and lemon juice. Using Creme de Fleur and \[cherry water substitute\] cuts down on the sweetness and adds herbal notes that make this a nice alternative to the classic.

- 1 oz. Tattersall Gin
- ¾ oz. Cherry Water (see below)
- ½ oz. Tattersall Creme de Fleur
- ¼ oz. Lemon Juice
- ¼ oz. Simple Syrup

Shake, Strain, Coupe

Lemon Peel Garnish

CHERRY WATER: The Modern Interpretation
<br>
Tattersall followed this recipe almost to a T, only reducing the cinnamon and nutmeg somewhat and leaving out the ambergris.

WATER OF FLOWERS: THE HISTORICAL RECIPE
<br>
*Water of Flowers. The greater quantity.
<br>
Take strong proof-spirit what sufficeth, and put it into a wide mouthed Pot, (or other Vessel) stopt very close. Take those several flowers following in their seasons, and being clean pickt, put them to the spirit in the pot,* viz. *Cow slips wood-bind, stock jilly flowers of all three sorts, Damask roses, Musk Roses, Sweet Brier flowers, Clove Jilly-flowers, Lilium Convallium, Jasmine, Citron flowers, or pils dry, Orange flowers, or pils dry, Tillia flowers, Garden Thyme flowers, Limon Thyme flowers, Wild Thyme flowers; Lavender flowers, Marigold flowers, Chamomile flowers, Mellilot flowers, Elder flowers, of each half a pound. Being furnished with all your flowers as above, when you would distill them, add to them Anniseed 2 pound, Coriander 1 pound; bruise the seeds; it were best to bruise all the flowers; as you put them up into the spirit, for their more orderly working; distil them into strong Proof-spirit according to art; then add to the distilled water, Roses, Jilly flowers, Elder flowers, of each 1 pound: after twelve dayes infusion it may be drawn off; then dulcifie it with white Sugar 10 pound, and being fine, it may be drawn for use."* [^7]

<br>
In their recreation, Tattersall included orange blossom water, cowslips, honeysuckle, cabbage roses, brier roses, linden, jasmine, lavender, marigold, chamomile, elderflower, melilot, lemon peel, lemon thyme, anise seeds, and coriander. One ingredient, the Lilium Convallium—lily of the valley—is poisonous, so was left out of this modern recreation.
