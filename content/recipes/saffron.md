[Bitters] (https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/what-are-bitters-and-how-to-use-them-cocktails-article) are made by infusing bitter botanicals in a high-proof base alcohol.[^2] Today they are a key flavoring component in cocktails; however, they first came into widespread use as medicinal aids. According to alcohol historian David Wondrich, when hungover Europeans started adding bitters to their wine and brandy as a restorative "hair of the dog" in the 1700s, they planted the seeds for the cocktails we enjoy today.[^3]

True to form, this 1820 bitters recipe packs a medicinal punch. Notably, it features gentian root, an herb used for millennia to treat a variety of ailments that is proven to calm the stomach and help digestion (when consumed in moderation, so drink responsibly!). Gentian remains a key ingredient in [Angostura bitters] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/one-weird-cocktail-has-spread-to-menus-worldwide-because-it-works/2015/09/27/7cdb0f6c-62e7-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.501537cc7e98). [^4]

Saffron---made from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus flower, with origins in the Middle East---has also long been used to treat a range of ailments. An important source for yellow dye, saffron's major contribution to this Wine Bitters is a pleasing, golden undertone. The dominant vibrant red color comes thanks to cochineal, a red dye formulated by the Aztecs and Maya of Central America from pulverized cochineal insects around 4,000 years ago. Today, cochineal is still [widely used] (https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43786055) as a food and drink colorant, and it remains an important export for Peru; it is not, however, vegetarian.[^5] In 2006 [Campari] (https://daily.sevenfifty.com/bug-based-coloring-makes-a-comeback-in-spirits/) opted for artificial color in its iconic red bitters.[^6]

For a low alcohol option, add this saffron bitters to tonic water---a quinine-infused refreshment favored by Brits in colonial India for its antimalarial properties. Until synthetic quinine was developed in 1944, the natural version was derived from Peruvian [cinchona bark] (https://www.lib.umn.edu/bell/tradeproducts/cinchonabark); Europeans started importing cinchona bark for antimalarial medicines in the 1630s, after which it quickly took off.[^8] The Wangensteen Historical Library has an early manuscript example of an English recipe that uses cinchona against malaria: in 1659, Chris Dodssonn wrote his copy of Nicholas Culpepers' translation of the *Pharmacopoeia Londinensis,* "For your ague: Take 2 drams of Quin Quina or Jesuit's Bark, beat it to a powder & infuse it in a draught of Clarit or white wine 2 hours & take it when your fitt begins & cetera."[^9]

Added to the mix is some mint syrup with origins in a Spanish-Morrocan medicinal recipe from the 1200s. Mint has been used for centuries (and still is!) to ease digestion.

### [Mint Syrup ]{.underline}Historic Recipe Transcription[^11]

Take mint and basil, grapefruit and cloves, a fistful of each. Cook all covered in water until its substance separates. Add what is clarified from this to a pound of sugar. In the bag: An ounce of clove flowers. Cook all together until it becomes syrup. Its benefits include liberating phlegm from the body and drying up phlegmatic urine. It fortifies the liver and stomach and makes the latter happy. In this it is admirable.

### \[MOVE TO APPENDIX, BUT INCLUDE NOTE/JUMP BEHIND THAT DIRECTS READERS THERE\] [Mint Syrup:]{.underline} UMN Premodern Food Laboratory's Modern Take

Michelle Hamilton, Director of Medieval Studies at the University of Minnesota, found this recipe. She brought the recipe to a meeting of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities Premodern Food Laboratory, where Emily Beck and Erin Crowley, PhD candidate in archaeology at the University of Minnesota, worked on re-creating it.

Three main questions arose while recreating this recipe. First, how big is a "fistful"? Second, what does a "fistful of grapefruit" mean? Do you use the peel or the fruit? And, third, could we have equal parts of all of these ingredients without the cloves completely taking over?

We ended up with the following recipe, although you could adjust the ingredients according to your preferences:
<ul>
<li>Approx. 1 cup fresh mint leaves</li>
<li>Approx. 1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
<li>Approx. 1 cup grapefruit peel</li>
<li>Approx. ¼ cup cloves</li>
</ul>
Heat together in a small saucepan with enough water to cover the ingredients. Cook until mixture is fragrant and very flavorful, perhaps 20 minutes. Strain to remove the ingredients, return the water to the stove, and add 1 lb granulated sugar. Simmer until all of the sugar has dissolved and the liquid is somewhat reduced. Keep in the refrigerator.
