MINT SYRUP: Historic Recipe Transcription[^1]
<br>
*Take mint and basil, grapefruit and cloves, a fistful of each. Cook all covered in water until its substance separates. Add what is clarified from this to a pound of sugar. In the bag: An ounce of clove flowers. Cook all together until it becomes syrup. Its benefits include liberating phlegm from the body and drying up phlegmatic urine. It fortifies the liver and stomach and makes the latter happy. In this it is admirable.*

**MINT SYRUP: UMN Premodern Food Laboratory's Modern Take**
<br>
Michelle Hamilton, Director of Medieval Studies at the University of Minnesota, found this recipe. She brought the recipe to a meeting of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities Premodern Food Laboratory, where Emily Beck and Erin Crowley, PhD candidate in archaeology at the University of Minnesota, worked on re-creating it.

Three main questions arose while recreating this recipe. First, how big is a "fistful"? Second, what does a "fistful of grapefruit" mean? Do you use the peel or the fruit? And, third, could we have equal parts of all of these ingredients without the cloves completely taking over?

We ended up with the following recipe, although you could adjust the ingredients according to your preferences:
<ul>
<li>Approx. 1 cup fresh mint leaves</li>
<li>Approx. 1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
<li>Approx. 1 cup grapefruit peel</li>
<li>Approx. ¼ cup cloves</li>
</ul>
Heat together in a small saucepan with enough water to cover the ingredients. Cook until mixture is fragrant and very flavorful, perhaps 20 minutes. Strain to remove the ingredients, return the water to the stove, and add 1 lb granulated sugar. Simmer until all of the sugar has dissolved and the liquid is somewhat reduced. Keep in the refrigerator.
