This collaborative initiative attempts to address that omission. It began with a question: what alcoholic drinks would have been served at an eighteenth-century Parisian house party?\nParticularly one hosted by Jean Gaillard de la Bouëxière, the original owner of Mia\u0026rsquo;s Grand Salon and a fermier général, or royal tax collector. The answer soon emerged: wine and its sweeter, distilled relative, brandy.3 These grape-based tipples were also top taxable commodities and a massive source of revenue for the French economy\u0026mdash;not to mention Gaillard de la Bouëxière\u0026rsquo;s bank account. One could say his salon\u0026mdash;a room designed for entertaining\u0026mdash;was, fittingly, built with wine.\n What alcoholic drinks would have been served at an eighteenth-century Parisian house party?\n France, Grand Salon from the Hôtel de la Bouëxière, 1735, wood, paint, plaster, gilt, marble, iron Gift of the Groves Foundation, Minneapolis Institute of Art   Around the same time, a few steps away from the Grand Salon\u0026mdash;but worlds away, culturally\u0026mdash;the austere Providence Parlor was reinvigorated with an installation, \u0026ldquo;Just Imported: Global Trade in 1700s New England.\u0026rdquo;4 This historic interior originated in the 1772 Rhode Island property of the Russell brothers, who sold goods imported at their store, The Sign of the Golden Eagle.5 An interactive station at the center of the room displays samples of the kinds of wares they sold, all gleaned from the Russell brothers\u0026rsquo; newspaper advertisements.6 United States, Providence Parlour, 1760–70, pine The William Hood Dunwoody Fund, Minneapolis Institute of Art   Amid the assortment is a bottle of rum from the British island of Jamaica. But New England rum also shared a surprising connection with the \u0026ldquo;grape lobby\u0026rdquo; of Gaillard de la Bouëxière\u0026rsquo;s world. Slaveholding French and British Caribbean plantations were leading centers of rum production where, right next to the sugar cane fields, the juice and molasses cast off in the sugar-refining process were collected and distilled to make rum.\n Through these period rooms we get a glimpse of the complex geographies of alcohol and their tangled histories in the 1700s Atlantic world.\n While Britain\u0026mdash;which had no major alcohol industry, except beer and, later, gin\u0026mdash;welcomed rum into its ports, in 1713 the French government formally prohibited both the production of French rum and its import into France or French colonies in a move to protect domestic wine and brandy makers.7 However, there is evidence that French Caribbean rum (known as tafia) was illicitly produced and traded in modest quantities, making its way to French Canadian territories, African slave-trading ports, and in numerous other sites in the Atlantic world. But, more importantly, French West Indies sugar planters sought ways to commercialize their molasses by-products and found crucial outlets in British New England, where the local rum industry flourished thanks to the influx of cheap French molasses.

Source: Wikimedia   The New England trade went on for decades, despite its violation of French decrees under the Exclusif system (which exclusively restricted trade between France and her colonies) and was contested by Britain until the American Revolution. As a result, the rum available at The Sign of the Golden Eagle could very well have had origins on French colonial plantations, much like the indigo the store sold.\nThrough these period rooms we get a glimpse of the complex geographies of alcohol and their tangled histories in the 1700s Atlantic world.

Jones Fund, by exchange, Minneapolis Institute of Art   William Hogarth, Gin Lane, 1750–51, etching and engraving\nView in Collection The Herschel V. Jones Fund, by exchange, Minneapolis Institute of Art   During this century of colonization and globalization, new drinks like rum grew out of intensifying systems of forced labor, along with new global commodities, like sugar.8 Enslaved Africans on Spanish plantations in today\u0026rsquo;s Dominican Republic likely first experimented with fermented sugar-based alcohols in the 1500s, as they sought methods to make something similar to the palm wine of their homelands. (Spain, also home to thriving wine and brandy industries, eventually made rum manufacture illegal in its American colonies.) It is also possible that prototypical rum production diffused into the Caribbean northwards from Brazil, where the Portuguese dominated global sugar production by 1600. At the same time, increases in long-distance shipping drove the demand for distilled spirits because, with their much higher alcohol content, spirits did not spoil as easily as beer or wine, and sailors relied on alcohol as part of their rations. But colonial powers, with their distinct cultural attitudes and economic anxieties surrounding old, new, and emerging strains of alcohol, both fueled and thwarted the global distribution of alcohol in different ways.\nNotes  \u0026ldquo;Living Rooms: The Period Rooms Initiative,\u0026rdquo; Minneapolis Institute of Art, Accessed November 13, 2018, https://new.artsmia.org/living-rooms/ ↩ \u0026ldquo;Up All Night in the 1700s,\u0026rdquo; Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Accessed November 13, 2018, https://new.artsmia.org/living-rooms/up-all-night/ ↩ Noelle Plack, \u0026ldquo;Intoxication and the French Revolution,\u0026rdquo; Age of Revolutions, December 5, 2016, https://bit.ly/2zOK7o1 ↩ \u0026ldquo;Just Imported,\u0026rdquo; Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Accessed November 13, 2018, https://new.artsmia.org/living-rooms/just-imported/ ↩ Matthew Powers, \u0026ldquo;Joseph and William Russell House,\u0026rdquo; Clio, Last Updated September 7, 2018, https://www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=65325 ↩ Carl Robert Keyes, \u0026ldquo;March 19,\u0026rdquo; The Adverts 250 Project, March 19, 2018, https://adverts250project.org/2018/03/19/march-19-3/ ↩ Melvyn Bragg (host), \u0026ldquo;The Gin Craze,\u0026rdquo; In Our Time, BBC Radio 4, August 9, 2018, https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/in-our-time/id73330895?mt=2\u0026amp;i=1000417483717 ↩ Bertie Mandelblatt, \u0026ldquo;Trans-Imperial Geographies of Rum: Production and Circulation,\u0026rdquo; Age of Revolutions, November 28, 2016, https://bit.ly/2fxNNmT ↩   ","id":1,"length":992,"title":"Alcohol in the 1700s Atlantic World","type":"entry","url":"https://kristhayer11.github.io/repo1/intro/essay1/"},{"content":" Before developments in global trade imprinted the importance of alcohol on Atlantic colonial economies, alcohol had, for centuries, a strong presence in medical practice within European regional economies and food cultures. The process of fermentation, where sugars and yeast collide to produce alcohol, emerged in different parts of the world during the Neolithic period thousands of years ago. The earliest evidence of wine made from fermented grapes comes from the Caucasus region, in Georgia, about 8,000 years ago. Distilling involves concentrating (increasing the alcohol ratio, or \u0026ldquo;proof\u0026rdquo;) a base alcohol by removing water and other impurities through evaporation and condensation.1 Arab-Persian alchemists in the Middle East started experimenting with distilled alcohols in the 800s for medical applications. It took about 300 years for this technology to spread to Europe, where distilled alcohols first gained currency in the treatment of maladies. Although the guests entertained in spaces such as the Grand Salon and the Providence Parlor perhaps did not think of their beverages as medicinal, much of what they imbibed was shaped by earlier medical theories and herbal remedies. The Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine at the University of Minnesota (WHL) holds a collection of manuscript (handwritten) recipe books. During the medieval and early modern periods, when university-educated physicians were scarce and costly, people often managed their own health. From the 1100s, when distilling took hold in Europe, religious orders and both male and female heads of household often distilled medicines for their family members and community at large.

Like an earlier version of Pinterest, the Wangensteen\u0026rsquo;s recipe books were used to keep track of everything people could possibly make in their households. Entries for human and animal medicine intermingled with agricultural advice and recipes for food and, even, invisible ink. These volumes reveal the problems and curiosities that people investigated in their homes. England, Drug pot, 1750, ceramic, metal, delftware\nView in the Collection Gift of Mr. and Mrs. George R. Steiner, Minneapolis Institute of Art   They made remedies, mostly from plant matter, to cure a variety of serious and mundane illnesses. In large private households, estates, and monasteries, people often produced batches of medicine that required specialized equipment and containers, such as the drug pot on the right. Many of these commonly used plants remain essential to the practice of herbal medicine today. They are also still fundamental ingredients in the modern cocktail landscape. Though the modern cocktail was not invented until the nineteenth century, eighteenth-century experiments made possible the spirits, liqueurs, low-proof punches, and bitters on which today\u0026rsquo;s cocktail-lovers enjoy. Like rum and brandy in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world, herbs and spices were prominent actors in global trade, exploration, and colonization. Europeans had long been accustomed to spices like ginger, black pepper, and cinnamon due to extensive trade along the Mediterranean between Italy, Spain, North Africa, and the Middle East. The early centuries of heightened exploration into the Western Hemisphere provided an exciting opportunity for Europeans looking to profit from new plant materials from as-yet, at least to them, unknown locales.\n Like rum and brandy in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world, herbs and spices were prominent actors in global trade, exploration, and colonization.\n Cinchona calisaya Wedd. Howard, J.E., Illustrations of the Nueva Quinologia of Pavon, t. 27 1862 W.H. Fitch\nSource   Certain food items, like maize, tomatoes, and potatoes, made the journey to Europe and became integral to regional cuisines, such as tomato sauce and polenta in Italy and the potato-based tortilla española in Spain. Many of the items that were so exciting to the colonial powers of Spain, England, and France were seen to be potentially useful medicinally. For example, Europeans had high hopes for the bark of the cinchona tree, sometimes called Jesuit\u0026rsquo;s Bark, which they thought of as a miraculous cure for many diseases, including syphilis. Although it is ineffective for that use, they learned from indigenous Peruvians that it could treat malaria. The active ingredient in cinchona bark, quinine, continues to be used today as an antimalarial.\n European medicine in the premodern period relied on theories that defined health as a perfect internal balance of four humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm.\n Alchemic approach to four humors in relation to the four elements and zodiacal signs. 1574 Book illustration in “Quinta Essentia” by Leonhart Thurneisser zum Thurn (gen.

Source: Wikimedia   European medicine in the premodern period relied on theories that defined health as a perfect internal balance of four humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. External factors, such as food, weather, pestilence, and physical activity, as well as divine intervention, were understood to throw humors out of balance, resulting in illness. So, medicines\u0026mdash;as well as foods and beverages\u0026mdash;were carefully designed to restore or maintain each person\u0026rsquo;s internal harmony. Alcohol was essential to this program of early herbal medicine because it is such an excellent carrier of other ingredients. Distilling or infusing spirits with herbs and other ingredients is a way of transferring their flavors, smells, and colors into a liquid that is shelf-stable, often for long periods of time when alcohol levels are sufficiently high. Through the distillation process, the \u0026ldquo;bite\u0026rdquo; of alcohol, too, might have made the original ingredient appear amplified. Hence, medicinal ingredients, such as cinchona bark, were distilled or infused into spirits like brandy and rum in order to make medicines and, later, recreational beverages.2\nNotes  \u0026ldquo;How Distilling Works,\u0026rdquo; Vine Pair, accessed November 8, 2018, https://vinepair.com/spirits-101/how-distilling-works/ ↩ Smitha Mundasad, \u0026ldquo;Alcohol Therapy: Medicinal Drinking Through the Ages,\u0026rdquo; BBC News, January 15, 2014. ↩   ","id":2,"length":956,"title":"Ingredients, Health \u0026 Household Medical Culture","type":"entry","url":"https://kristhayer11.github.io/repo1/intro/essay2/"},{"content":" This project has been a joint effort of the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia), the Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine at the University of Minnesota, and Tattersall Distilling in Minneapolis. It was driven by individuals who are interested in material culture, recreating historical products, and searching for unique flavors. We have researched countless beverages and recreated and tasted many of them. Our unique combination of interest, expertise, and creative spirit has resulted in an interesting, evocative, and delicious project that we are very happy to share with you.\nTasting session held in summer 2018 at Tattersall Distilling; far left, head distiller Bentley Gilman.   This interdisciplinary exploration into alcohol\u0026rsquo;s past was ignited by Mia\u0026rsquo;s commitment to breathe new life into its period rooms by offering visitors new ways to connect with and experience these spaces. The goal was to give people a chance not only to learn about but actually to taste some of the historic drinks that the former occupants of the rooms and their contemporaries might have enjoyed. Recipe selection was guided by the books in the Wangensteen Historical Library\u0026rsquo;s collections of recipes handwritten or printed in English between the late 1600s and early 1800s. The library\u0026rsquo;s collections and long-term commitment to historical recipes research and the reconstruction of historical materialities provided the specific recipes and historical context necessary to understanding the broad scope of alcohol in the 1700s. By focusing on recipes that feature rum and brandy, we can see how these base spirits were integrated into the drinking culture of English writers of this era. Tattersall Distilling provided the practical expertise and artisanal knowledge necessary to recreate these historical recipes.\nThe Art of Distillation. John French. London: E. Cotes, 1667. Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine, University of Minnesota.   This effort culminated in two events held at Mia and at Tattersall: a lecture on rum in the 1700s Atlantic world by Bertie Mandelblatt, the George S. Parker II \u0026lsquo;51 Curator of Maps and Prints at the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, Rhode Island, hosted at the museum on March 3, 2019; and a tasting event held at Tattersall Distilling on March 4, 2019. At the tasting event, guests had the opportunity to sample the drinks included in this recipe book, of which many are based on recipes in the Wangensteen\u0026rsquo;s collection; all were brought to life by the artisans at Tattersall through a patient process of experimentation, testing, and refinement. We hope the recipe book makes this singular event accessible to an even broader public.\nJon Kreidler, co-founder and chief officer at Tattersall Distilling, with a bottle of milk punch. At right, milk punch and two bottles of aquavit.   Because of alcohol\u0026rsquo;s centrality to 1700s medical culture, many of our featured recipes originated as cures. Although people in the 1700s would not have consumed many high-proof remedies for enjoyment, some of these old restoratives survive as modern cocktail components, such as bitters. Other recipes, however, were intended to be enjoyable beverages on their own. Within this group, milk punch is experiencing a modern revival (although ours can, as the recipe says, survive a journey from Europe to the Indies in the belly of a ship).1 Others, like aquavit, are simply one in a long, European-wide tradition of anise-flavored spirits.\nAcross all of these recipes, the ingredients themselves tell stories about the people, products, techniques, and taste preferences that traversed the Atlantic in the 1700s. For example, ingredients such as Middle Eastern saffron, or Latin American cinchona and cochineal, highlight the global beverage culture of these European authors.

Case Study: Aquavit Aniseed to \u0026lsquo;Cause a Sweet Breath\u0026rsquo; What do pastis, ouzo, sambuca, aquavit, and absinthe have in common? A base flavor of anise. In re-creating this aqua-vitae recipe from The London-Distiller, we\u0026rsquo;re able to chart the transformation of this very old spirit since the 1600s, with anise flavoring so many spirits throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. 1 According to Nicholas Culpeper, aniseed could be used to \u0026ldquo;ease pain [\u0026amp;] expel wind, cause a sweet breath, help the dropsie, resist poyson, breed milk, and stop the whites in women, provoke lust, and ease the headach.\u0026rdquo; 2 Given the pleasing flavor and medical and digestive utility of anise, it is not surprising that anise-flavored alcohols are so common.\nThe recipe for aqua-vitae transcribed below was the second recipe included in The London-Distiller. It is ubiquitous throughout the volume as a base spirit that could take on the flavor of other ingredients. AQUAVIT: Historical Recipe Transcription 3 \u0026ldquo;Aqua-vitae, the second part.

In total, we use 15 botanicals, and then rest the finished spirit on oak to bring the flavors together, [and] add an additional flavor as well as some color to the finished product.\u0026rdquo;\nTattersall\u0026rsquo;s aquavit garnered Best of Class and Double-Gold at both the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and the American Distilling Institute awards. The contemporary adaptation of the historical recipe reveals the complexity, balance, and ingenuity of the distiller\u0026rsquo;s art.\n\nNotes  For more on anise-flavored spirits, see: R.

This transcription appears with a modernized and tested recipe that readers are encouraged to try for themselves. Many of the recipes originally contained ingredients that are poisonous or impossible to acquire, so the modern versions rely on ingredients that approximate the flavor profiles of the originals. Each recipe also includes historical context and information about the distillation process from members of the project team. Three entries include bespoke cocktail recipes\u0026mdash;one-of-a-kind creations developed by Tattersall\u0026rsquo;s co-founder and chief operator, Dan Oskey, for this project.

We have also included information on some unique distillations Tattersall developed for the tasting event, such as Plague Water and Water of Flowers. These appear in the Bonus Material for reference only.\n How might today’s spirits compare to their 1700s predecessors? In truth, they probably tasted pretty dissimilar.  Because at-home distillation is illegal, these recipes involve the use of ready-made distilled alcohols as either a base for infusions or as a component for mixing. Which raises the question: how might today\u0026rsquo;s spirits compare to their 1700s predecessors? In truth, they probably tasted pretty dissimilar. In the 1800s, the invention of the column still made it possible to produce purer, higher quality spirits than one could achieve with the earlier pot still. Also around this time, alcohol producers started to realize the importance of removing the \u0026ldquo;heads\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;tails\u0026rdquo; from distilling runs. This meant that in the 1600s and 1700s a number of toxins\u0026mdash;such as acetone, the stuff in nail polish remover\u0026mdash;produced at the beginning and end of the run made their way into the final product. Today, alcohol producers tend to cut out the \u0026ldquo;heads\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;tails.\u0026rdquo; As a result, 1700s rum probably tasted much richer, and \u0026ldquo;funkier,\u0026rdquo; than modern equivalents (and made for some nasty hangovers).

Additionally, it is unlikely that the historical ingredients in these recipes would have had exactly the same qualities as those we can obtain today. Wild foraged herbs may most closely approximate the historical herbs, but the genetic modifications to farmed ingredients, either through scientific methods or simple selection for traits over generations, mean that today\u0026rsquo;s orange is unlikely to be exactly the same as a 1700s orange. Regardless, the act of making and the experience of tasting these recreated recipes are powerful ways to increase our understanding of the ways people in the past experienced global flavors while treating their illnesses\u0026mdash;and their palates.\n","id":4,"length":457,"title":"The 1700s Drinking Culture Recipe Book","type":"entry","url":"https://kristhayer11.github.io/repo1/intro/essay4/"},{"content":" About the Minneapolis Institute of Art Established in 1883, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, or Mia, is committed to enriching the community by collecting, preserving, and making accessible outstanding works of art from the world\u0026rsquo;s diverse cultures.

One important exception was punch, which became popular worldwide in the 1600s. Punch combined five basic components: citrus juice, sugar, botanicals, water, and distilled spirits\u0026mdash;usually rum, brandy, or arrack, a beverage made from either rice, palm juice, or coconut flower sap, common throughout South and Southeast Asia.\n If punch did begin life aboard long-haul voyages, it quickly jumped ship, making its way into well-to-do homes, where people could afford the costly ingredients.\n As for punch\u0026rsquo;s origins, some clues point to India, and others to the practical needs and available resources of European sailors. As part of their victuals, sailors had increased access to distilled alcohols during the 1600s. And beginning in the late 1500s, some European ships had citrus on hand to combat scurvy, long before such fruits were formally doled out as rations and scientifically understood as antiscorbutics. Sugar and spices were often part of the cargo. If punch did begin life aboard long-haul voyages, it quickly jumped ship, making its way into well-to-do homes, where people could afford the costly ingredients (one citrus fruit in 1700s Europe cost the modern equivalent of roughly $8).\nWith its frequently heavy dose of lime or lemon juice, punch was highly acidic; one way to counteract its zing was to add sugar. Another way, discovered somewhere in the late 1600s, was to add milk, which unfortunately curdles on contact with citric acid. But with patient straining, milk punch could be clarified, removing the milk solids and leaving behind a smooth texture and creamy taste due to the whey. It could also be bottled and stored for later use. By the mid 1700s, milk punch was extremely popular and enjoyed its ride into the late 1800s.\nClarified milk punch is different from and older than modern single-serve cocktails such as \u0026ldquo;bourbon milk punch,\u0026rdquo; which is not strained and cannot be stored. The following recipe, published in Ireland, was for a milk punch that would keep during the voyage to \u0026ldquo;either of the Indies,\u0026rdquo; meaning either the Americas or Asia. MILK PUNCH: Historic Recipe Transcription 1 To make Milk Punch that will keep Years by Sea or Land. Steep the Peel of twenty Lemons, and of four Seville Oranges, in six Quarts of Brandy or Rum, for twenty-four Hours; and then add two Quarts of Lemon and Orange Juice (almost three Parts of Seville Orange Juice) five Quarts of Water, four large Nutmegs grated, and two Pounds and a Half of double-refined Sugar. When these have stood twenty-four Hours, add three Quarts and a Pint of boiling Milk; then let the whole stand about twelve Hours; after which run it through a Jelly-Bag, till the Liquor becomes quite clear. This will keep good to either of the Indies.

William Curtis, Gentian, The Botanical magazine, or, Flower garden displayed, London: S. Couchman. Volume 2, 1789.\nWHL   Bitters are made by infusing bitter botanicals in a high-proof base alcohol.1 Today they are a key flavoring component in cocktails; however, they first came into widespread use as medicinal aids. According to alcohol historian David Wondrich, when hungover Europeans started adding bitters to their wine and brandy as a restorative \u0026ldquo;hair of the dog\u0026rdquo; in the 1700s, they planted the seeds for the cocktails we enjoy today.2\nTrue to form, this 1820 bitters recipe packs a medicinal punch. Notably, it features gentian root, an herb used for millennia to treat a variety of ailments that is proven to calm the stomach and help digestion (when consumed in moderation, so drink responsibly!). Gentian remains a key ingredient in Angostura bitters. 3\n William Woodville, Saffron crocus, Medical botany : containing systematic and general descriptions, with plates of all the medicinal plants, comprehended in the catalogues of the materia medica, as published by the Royal Colleges of Physicians of London, Edinburg, and Dublin \u0026hellip;, London: John Bohn, 1832: Volume 4. 615.32 W86 1832\nWHL   Saffron\u0026mdash;made from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus flower, a plant with origins in the Middle East\u0026mdash;has also long been used to treat a range of ailments. An important source for yellow dye, saffron\u0026rsquo;s major contribution to this Wine Bitters is a pleasing, golden undertone. The dominant vibrant red color comes thanks to cochineal, a red dye formulated by the Aztecs and Maya of Central America from pulverized cochineal insects around 4,000 years ago. Today, cochineal is still widely used as a food and drink colorant, and it remains an important export for Peru; it is not, however, vegetarian.4 In 2006 Campari opted for artificial color in its iconic red bitters.5\n\nFor a low alcohol option, add this saffron bitters to tonic water\u0026mdash;a quinine-infused refreshment once favored by Brits in colonial India for its antimalarial properties. Until synthetic quinine was developed in 1944, the natural version was derived from Peruvian cinchona bark; Europeans started importing cinchona bark for antimalarial medicines in the 1630s, after which it quickly took off.6 The Wangensteen Historical Library has an early manuscript example of an English recipe that uses cinchona against malaria: in 1659, Chris Dodssonn wrote in his copy of Nicholas Culpepers\u0026rsquo; translation of the Pharmacopoeia Londinensis, \u0026ldquo;For your ague: Take 2 drams of Quin Quina or Jesuit\u0026rsquo;s Bark, beat it to a powder \u0026amp; infuse it in a draught of Clarit or white wine 2 hours \u0026amp; take it when your fitt begins \u0026amp; cetera.\u0026rdquo;7\nAdded to the mix is some mint syrup with origins in a Spanish-Morrocan medicinal recipe from the 1200s. Mint has been used for centuries (and still is!) to ease digestion.

Centuria I-VI. Abbildungen von Arzneygewächsen. Nürnberg: Auf Kosten der Raspischen Buchhandlung, 1779: Volume 1.\nWHL   In the 1800s, distilled spirits were made by both professional distillers and by individuals in their households. This recipe for Cherrie Water originated from a handwritten \u0026ldquo;Book of Receipts\u0026rdquo; by Ann Ward, written around 1724. The spirits Ward made at home, such as this one, would have been primarily for household medicinal use. Individuals like Ward didn\u0026rsquo;t only include medicinal recipes in their journals, however; all sorts of useful household information ranging from human and veterinary medicine to cooking and mischief were recorded there.\nIn addition to the recipe for Cherrie Water, transcribed below, Ward included culinary recipes such as \u0026ldquo;A ffrigasye of Chickins or Rabbitts,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;A Rice pudding to Bake,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;To make a seed cake,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;To Pickle little Gerkine Cowcummers.\u0026rdquo;1 Mingled among the recipes for food are those for human medicine and animal care. \u0026ldquo;The Purging Ale to be taken Every Springe\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Snaile water which is good for any weakness to Recover Nature and the Jandy\u0026rsquo;s or Consumption\u0026rdquo; highlight the role that Ann Ward had in helping to maintain the health of the people in her household.2 She even included a recipe to keep horses healthy: \u0026ldquo;Balls for Horses in Hunting Season,\u0026rdquo; which she asserted would \u0026ldquo;keep your Horse free from \u0026hellip; swel\u0026rsquo;d Legs \u0026amp; give him a Good appetite\u0026hellip; They are very good for Coach Horses.\u0026rdquo;3\nIn contrast to the household production of spirits like Cherrie Water, our recipe for Water of Flowers comes from The London-Distiller, Exactly and truly shewing The Way (in words at length, and not in mysterious CHARACTERS and FIGURES) to draw all Sorts of Spirits and Strong-Waters: To which is added Their Vertues, with Additions of many Excellent Waters, published in 1667. Author John French includes a section called \u0026ldquo;Rules and Directions for extracting and drawing of Low-Wines and Spirits, to be Re-distilled into Rich Spirits, Strong Waters, or Aqua-vitae\u0026rdquo; in which he describes the regulation of the Company of Distillers over distillation methods. He criticizes the cost-saving practice of some distillers to not re-distill their products: \u0026ldquo;What they save by their seeming thrift, they lose double in the excellency of their Wares.\u0026rdquo;4 Thus, according to French, \u0026ldquo;The directions following are henceforth by them and every member of the Company [of Distillers], and their Successors, duly and exactly to be observed and practised from time to time for here everafter.\u0026rdquo;5\n \u0026lsquo;Everyone knows what nail polish smells like.\u0026rsquo;\n The differences in the ways that people distill today, both for thrift and taste, still leads to varying qualities of alcohol. Bentley Gillman, head distiller at Tattersall Distilling, described the necessity of removing the \u0026ldquo;heads and tails\u0026rdquo; of distilled alcohol, which contain alcohols that are more toxic. \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re not making aggressive cuts, more acetone and methanol remains [in the product.] It tastes funky. Everyone knows what nail polish smells like. Think of a bell curve: we cut the low parts to focus on the curve. We throw away more, but it gives us a better product.

CLEAR SKIES AHEAD Tattersall Cocktail Recipe Clear Skies Ahead is our historical take on a classic Aviation. Developed in the early twentieth century, an Aviation typically calls for maraschino liqueur, gin, crème de violette, and lemon juice. Using crème de fleur and our historically inspired cherry (cherrie) water cuts down on the sweetness and adds herbal notes that make this a nice alternative to the classic. • 1 ounce Tattersall gin • ¾ ounce Luxardo, Maraschino, or Kirsch (store-bought options for Cherrie Water • ½ ounce Tattersall Crème de Fleur (store-bought option for Water of Flowers • ¼ ounce lemon juice • ¼ ounce simple syrup Shake.

By recreating these medicines and turning them into a cocktail, we explored the ways in which many modern spirits had their origins as medical treatments.\n Thomas Bartholin, Plague doctor, Thomæ Bartholini Historiarum anatomicarum rariorum, Hafniae: Sumptibus P. Hauboldt: 1654.\nWHL   Plague Water was one among a slew of medicines used by people in hopes of avoiding a grisly death from bubonic plague. Although many medicines in the 1700s were relatively effective, having come from centuries of trial, error, and empirical practice of herbal healers, the modern understanding of bacteria and vector-based diseases was not part of early modern medical theory. Nevertheless, this did not necessarily render their medicines ineffective. Herbal medicines can be potent cures against many illnesses, and some cures continue to be researched today for their antibacterial properties. 1 The recipe for Plague Water from The London Distiller is full of ingredients once thought to mitigate this feared illness. Angelica roots, for example, \u0026ldquo;is a singular remedy against pestilence and poyson.\u0026rdquo; 2 Contra Yerva was considered to be \u0026ldquo;binding and stops blood,\u0026rdquo; 3 and zedoary could \u0026ldquo;resist poyson.\u0026rdquo; 4\nFor centuries, black death, or black plague (now generally believed to be caused by the flea-carried bacterium Yersinia pestis) decimated European populations.5 During a series of epidemics in the 1300s, an estimated 25 million people died, with population levels only returning to their pre-black death levels 150 years later.\nGermany, Miniature Pendant with The Deposition of the Cross, and Saint Roch and Saint Sebastian, 1550, gold, enamel, stones, boxwood\nThis pendant may have been used to protect the wearer from plague.\nView in the Collection Gift of Tony, Lois and Ruth Blumka in memory of Victoria Blumka, Minneapolis Institute of Art   Black death has emerged throughout the world at various points in history, including in San Francisco in the early twentieth century, and in southern India in 1994.6 Bubonic plague continues to be endemic today in the rodent population of the Rocky Mountains. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around seven people per year contract the disease in the United States.7\nAlongside the Plague Water, Tattersall also recreated Aqua Mirabilis, which translates to Miraculous or Wonderful Water. The recipe specifically mentions that it can be used to cure palsy (paralysis or tremors), but it mentions that it is also very restorative. In addition to curing specific illnesses or symptoms, people in the 1700s also looked to everyday remedies to help maintain their health. By taking small amounts of medicines like Aqua Mirabilis daily in small quantities, like many take vitamins today, early modern individuals hoped that they would be able to stay generally healthy.\nTattersall fashioned these two medicines into an historically inspired cocktail because both of these herbal-forward spirits are reminiscent of modern spirits such as Green Chartreuse and Becherovka. During the early modern period, however, they would have likely been taken in small amounts on their own, or in a warm posset drink. In the 1700s, recipes flourished for possets and for medicinal waters, like plague water, to be taken in a posset, an ancestor of modern-day eggnog typically composed of warm wine or beer mixed with milk, to which medicines could be added. Later posset recipes show the addition of eggs and sugar, perhaps spurring the drink\u0026rsquo;s movement from medicinal into social realms.\nPosset pot, 1710–20, tin-glazed earthenware\nView in the Collection Gift of Mr. and Mrs. George R. Steiner, Minneapolis Institute of Art    Many early posset recipes reveal their role in helping women recover from childbirth. One recipe in a 1680 manuscript specifically refers to these patients and includes the name of the midwife who provided the recipe to the author: \u0026ldquo;A good Posset drink for a Woman [that] lies in. A quart of Milk put into it half a pint of water \u0026amp; when it boyles put in half a pint of white wine \u0026amp; run it through it through [sic] a sive on a handfull of Sage \u0026amp; cover it down.

The scordium was replaced with hops because the two are closely related. Snake grass is dangerous to humans, so licorice root was used instead, and lovage replaced impertoria. We omitted two significant ingredients: Venice treacle and mithridate. Both were extraordinarily complex and expensive medicines once produced by pharmacists across Europe as miraculous cures for all kinds of illnesses, and each had 50 to 70 distinct ingredients, including opium, viper\u0026rsquo;s flesh, and skink bellies. As much as we value authenticity, we agreed to drop them from the re-created recipe.10 Because this is a distilled product, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to substitute a store-bought alcohol.\nPLAGUE PARTY Tattersall Cocktail Recipe • 1 ounce Green Chartreuse (substitute for Plague Water) • \u0026frac12; ounce Becherovka (substitute for Aqua Mirabilis) • \u0026frac12; ounce pineapple juice • \u0026frac14; ounce honey sage syrup • \u0026frac14; ounce lemon juice Honey Sage Syrup: In a saucepan, add 1 cup honey, 1 cup water, and 1 tablespoon fresh sage roughly chopped.

Jump to: Mint Syrup Water of Flowers Aqua Mirabilis\n\nMint Syrup: ‘Fortifies the liver and stomach and makes the latter happy’ HISTORIC RECIPE TRANSCRIPTION 1 Take mint and basil, grapefruit and cloves, a fistful of each. Cook all covered in water until its substance separates. Add what is clarified from this to a pound of sugar. In the bag: An ounce of clove flowers. Cook all together until it becomes syrup. Its benefits include liberating phlegm from the body and drying up phlegmatic urine. It fortifies the liver and stomach and makes the latter happy. In this it is admirable.  UMN Premodern Food Laboratory\u0026rsquo;s Modern Take Michelle Hamilton, Director of Medieval Studies at the University of Minnesota, found this recipe. She brought the recipe to a meeting of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities Premodern Food Laboratory, where Emily Beck and Erin Crowley, PhD candidate in archaeology at the University of Minnesota, worked on re-creating it.\nThree main questions arose while recreating this recipe. First, how big is a \u0026ldquo;fistful\u0026rdquo;? Second, what does a \u0026ldquo;fistful of grapefruit\u0026rdquo; mean? Do you use the peel or the fruit? And, third, could we have equal parts of all of these ingredients without the cloves completely taking over?\nWe ended up with the following recipe, although you could adjust the ingredients according to your preferences: • Approx. 1 cup fresh mint leaves • Approx. 1 cup fresh basil leaves • Approx. 1 cup grapefruit peel • Approx. ¼ cup cloves Heat together in a small saucepan with enough water to cover the ingredients. Cook until mixture is fragrant and very flavorful, perhaps 20 minutes. Strain to remove the ingredients, return the water to the stove, and add 1 lb granulated sugar. Simmer until all of the sugar has dissolved and the liquid is somewhat reduced. Keep in the refrigerator. Water of Flowers: ‘Bruise the seeds; bruise all the flowers’ HISTORIC RECIPE TRANSCRIPTION 2 \u0026ldquo;Water of Flowers. The greater quantity. Take strong proof-spirit what sufficeth, and put it into a wide mouthed Pot, (or other Vessel) stopt very close. Take those several flowers following in their seasons, and being clean pickt, put them to the spirit in the pot, viz. Cow slips wood-bind, stock jilly flowers of all three sorts, Damask roses, Musk Roses, Sweet Brier flowers, Clove Jilly-flowers, Lilium Convallium, Jasmine, Citron flowers, or pils dry, Orange flowers, or pils dry, Tillia flowers, Garden Thyme flowers, Limon Thyme flowers, Wild Thyme flowers; Lavender flowers, Marigold flowers, Chamomile flowers, Mellilot flowers, Elder flowers, of each half a pound. Being furnished with all your flowers as above, when you would distill them, add to them Anniseed 2 pound, Coriander 1 pound; bruise the seeds; it were best to bruise all the flowers; as you put them up into the spirit, for their more orderly working; distil them into strong Proof-spirit according to art; then add to the distilled water, Roses, Jilly flowers, Elder flowers, of each 1 pound: after twelve dayes infusion it may be drawn off; then dulcifie it with white Sugar 10 pound, and being fine, it may be drawn for use.\u0026ldquo;  TATTERSALL\u0026rsquo;S CONTEMPORARY DISTILLATION In recreating the historical water of flowers, Tattersall included orange blossom water, cowslips, honeysuckle, cabbage roses, brier roses, linden, jasmine, lavender, marigold, chamomile, elderflower, melilot, lemon peel, lemon thyme, anise seeds, and coriander. Two ingredients were omitted: Lilium Convallium\u0026mdash;lily of the valley\u0026mdash;and gilly flowers\u0026mdash;clove flowers. Lily of the valley is poisonous, and fresh gilly flowers do not have the same flavor profile as dried clove buds. Because it is distilled, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to substitute a store-bought alcohol, such as Luxardo, Maraschino, or Kirsch.\nAqua Mirabilis: ‘Excellent against the palsy’ HISTORIC RECIPE TRANSCRIPTION 3  “Aqua Mirabilis. Take melilot, cardamum, cubebs, gallingale, cloves, ginger, mace, nutmegs, of each a dram, the juice of celandine, half a pint; mingle all these together, bruise to powder with the juice, and a pint of Aqua Vita, and three pints of white wine, put them together into a glass-still; let it stand all night, and in the morning distil it with a very gentle fire. It is excellent against the palsy, and very restorative. In the summer one spoonful may be taken in a week,fasting, and in the winter two spoonfuls.” \n\nTATTERSALL\u0026rsquo;S CONTEMPORARY INTERPRETATION Tattersall made a nearly exact recreation of this recipe, using a combination of aqua vitae from The London-Distiller’s recipe, white wine, and spices. The one change was to substitute an infusion of dried celandine rather than fresh celandine juice; fresh was unavailable.\nNotes  Hispanic (Andalusi)-Maghrebi (Morrocan) food during the Almohad period from an anonymous 13th century manuscript.

The Alcohol\u0026rsquo;s Empire project was a joint effort of the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia), the Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine at the University of Minnesota, and Tattersall Distilling in Minneapolis.\nThis interdisciplinary exploration into alcohol\u0026rsquo;s past was ignited by Mia\u0026rsquo;s commitment to breathe new life into its displays of historic interiors by offering visitors new ways to connect with and experience these spaces. Recipe selection was guided by the books in the Wangensteen Historical Library\u0026rsquo;s collections of recipes handwritten or printed in English between the late 1600s and early 1800s. Tattersall Distilling provided the practical expertise and artisanal knowledge necessary to recreate these historical recipes. Alcohol\u0026rsquo;s Empire was created in collaboration with Tattersall Distilling and the University of Minnesota\u0026rsquo;s Wangensteen Historical Library of Biology and Medicine.
